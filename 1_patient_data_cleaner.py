Patient Data Cleaner

This script standardizes and filters patient records according to specific rules:

Data Cleaning Rules:
1. Names: Capitalize each word (e.g., "john smith" -> "John Smith")
2. Ages: Convert to integers, set invalid ages to 0
3. Filter: Remove patients under 18 years old
4. Remove any duplicate records

Input JSON format:
    [
        {
            "name": "john smith",
            "age": "32",
            "gender": "male",
            "diagnosis": "hypertension"
        },
        ...
    ]

Output:
- Cleaned list of patient dictionaries
- Each patient should have:
  * Properly capitalized name
  * Integer age (â‰¥ 18)
  * Original gender and diagnosis preserved
- No duplicate records
- Prints cleaned records to console

Example:
    Input: {"name": "john smith", "age": "32", "gender": "male", "diagnosis": "flu"}
    Output: {"name": "John Smith", "age": 32, "gender": "male", "diagnosis": "flu"}
